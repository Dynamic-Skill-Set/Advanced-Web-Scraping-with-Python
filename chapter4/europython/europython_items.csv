Luba Elliott,July 2019,"Over the past couple of years, there has been increasing interest in applying the latest advances in machine learning to creative projects in art and design. From DeepDream and style transfer to a GAN-generated painting selling for $430,000 at auction, AI art has moved beyond the world of research and academia and become a trend in its own right. Meanwhile, the contemporary art world's fascination with the social impact of facial recognition, recommendation systems and deep fakes has encouraged artists to explore AI critically as subject matter. This talk will give an overview of how artists and technologists are using and thinking about machine learning, its creative potential and societal impact.","Algorithms,Computer Vision,Deep Learning",AI in Contemporary Art

Franziska Oschmann,July 2019,"Within the last 20 years machine learning (ML) experienced a boost in its impact on our daily lives. With the help of supervised and unsupervised methods tasks like computer vision, recognition of speech or text have been revolutionized. Due to this high impact of ML ongoing research focuses on the constant improvement of these methods. ,However, ML is not exclusively the subject of research, but can also be used as a tool for the investigation of research questions. For example, ML is used to uncover hidden patterns in experimental data not detectable with neither the human eye nor standard statistical methods or to train machines so that they can take over repetitive tasks like object recognition. The increasing usage of ML in research is also due to Python libraries such as keras or scikit-learn. These libraries have simplified the handling of ML methods and thus paved the way for the application of these methods in many different research fields.,This talk is intended to present examples for current applications of ML in research. These use cases deal with the automatic recognition of single neurons throughout a stack of histological images or the prediction of human arm movements based on EEG signals.

Lynn Root,July 2019,"By building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. We‚Äôll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code. We‚Äôll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent programming with Python‚Äôs asyncio library, take away some best practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.","ASYNC / Concurreny,Best Practice,Development",Advanced asyncio: Solving Real-world Production Problems

Shailen Sobhee,July 2019,"Learn about Intel¬Æ Deep Learning Boost, also known as Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI), a new set of AVX-512 instructions, that are designed to deliver significantly more efficient Deep Learning (Inference) acceleration. Through this technology, I will show you how you can perform low-precision (INT8) inference much faster on hardware that support the VNNI instruction set (for example, the 2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors, codenamed, Cascade Lake). In the live Jupyter notebook session, you can will be able to see the benefits of this new hardware technology.

Lynn Cherny,July 2019,"Most of us work too much and play too little.¬† When was the last time you smiled at something you made?¬† Playing with fun datasets, especially big data sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation.¬† Why not train an amusing model in a browser tab while you're waiting for that day-job Spark query to finish?¬† I'll show you some data toys I've built using AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend data science and front-end visualization tricks.¬† They range from poetry-composition helpers to game log analysis to image deconstruction and reconstruction. All of them taught me something, often about myself and what I like artistically, and sometimes about what ""big data"" actually means.","Big Data,Deep Learning,Visualization",Getting Your Data Joie De Vivre Back!
