SpaCy already provides mechanisms for dealing with natural languages in general but does not offer means for sentiment analysis. This talk gives a short introduction to sentiment analysis in general and shows how to extract topics and ratings by utilizing spaCy’s basic tools and extending them with a lexicon based approach and simple Python code to consolidate sentiments spread over multiple words. Topic covered are: Code examples are introduced and explained using a Jupyter notebook that can be used as basis for your own analysis. As additional twist the analyzed texts are not in English but German to show that this approach can be used for multiple languages. No knowledge of German is required though because translations of the short examples sentences are provided.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Beginners Notebook Programming Natural Language Processing</tags></item><item><title>Interoperability Rules for an European API Ecosystem: do we still need SOAP?</title><author>Roberto Polli</author><description>Italy is introducing a new API Ecosystem because the complexity of the old SOAP-based protocol was now a barrier for the creation of newer services.

But should your application care? Should it need to know whether it’s running on your notebook, on a server, in a Docker container, or in some cloud platform as a service? It should not, because environment-agnostic applications are easier to test, easier to deploy, easier to handle, and easier to scale. But how can you practically structure and configure your applications to make them indifferent to the environment they run in? How do secrets fit into the picture? And where do you put that log file? By the end of this talk you’ll know the tools and techniques that enable you to write such Python applications and you’ll be ready for the next big change.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Scaling Deployment/Continuous Integration and Delivery Architecture DevOps general</tags></item><item><title>Integration Tests with Super Powers</title><author>Alexandre Figura</author><description>You are maybe like me: I never learned at school how to write tests. My teachers gave me at first a broad overview of computer history. Then, they explained me some basic design patterns. And to finish, I often had to write more or less basic programs, to validate and demonstrate my skills. Not the kind of code I would be really proud of today: the procrastinator monkey living in my head at this time was more thinking about planning my summer holidays, rather than writing Ninja code! And to make things worse, my studies focused on network and system engineering. Not software architecture. Funny story, because I decided to become programmer a couple of years later… What I realize now is that I don’t have as much time as before to learn. And in a world driven by business, where time is money, and where tradeoffs are the rule, there is rarely enough money to write both shiny new features and a complete test suite. People who practice Test-Driven Development know how complicated it can be to write proper tests. TDD is often discouraging at first: the learning curve is steep. But this problem also exists in the testing world in general. Because writing good tests is hard, many beginners get headaches trying to reach this goal. How to convince project managers to have more time for writing tests in these conditions… But “le jeu en vaut la chandelle” as we say in French ("the juice is worth the squeeze"). Well tested applications are not only easier to maintain and extend. They also have in general a better API. That’s what we will see in this talk, by focusing on how to write integration tests. Our journey will begin with a presentation of different testing strategies. We will then jump to the practical part, using Pytest, interface testing , dependency injections and stubs, amongst many others. And because we want to add nice buzzwords on our resume after EuroPython, we will finish this talk by automating the whole with Docker Compose.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Docker Testing Tooling Test Libraries (pyTest/node/...)</tags></item><item><title>How to write Rust instead of C, and get away with it (yes, it's a Python talk)</title><author>Antonio Verardi</author><description>Have you ever tried optimizing a super-slow Python application and thought: “Oh! I wish I could just write this bit it in Rust”? Well, turns out you can!
We will show you how Rust is a better alternative than C to make your programs lightning fast, and how to get away with it; without your users even noticing. As Infrastructure Engineers at Yelp, the challenge we face everyday is: scale. Yelp is mostly a Python shop and while this is great for development velocity, our work often revolves around making Python applications run faster. Until now, we have been using different techniques: faster interpreters, or, more often, C code. Given its safety guarantees, performance and promise of better tooling than C, we decided we had to give Rust a try. The initial results helped reinforce that there was a lot of opportunity for Rust to play an important role in our production code. Yelp heavily relies on the Apache Avro (https://avro.apache.org/) serialization format for its internal infrastructure. During the talk, we will show how we implemented an Avro serialization/deserialization library in Rust, how we were able to call it from Python (and in theory from any other language) with very little code, using tools such as cbindgen (https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/), CFFI (https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and Milksnake (https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake/). This talk would outline how easy it is to write performant code in a language like Rust and call it from Python applications without users even realizing it, making this a great solution for production services.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Performance CPython C-Languages</tags></item><item><title>How to make money using Python - Unused potential in the Enterprise World</title><author>Marc-Andre Lemburg</author><description>Python has gained quite some traction in the web development world and more recently as the goto language for anything that has to do with data science. However, it’s use in the enterprise world of applications is rather limited. Based on the author’s many years experience in working in enterprise environments, the talk will demonstrate areas in the business application space where Python has significant advantages over other languages, but which are currently dominated by applications written in Java, C++ or C#. There are huge opportunities out there for companies to excel at and use the Python advantage to their benefit. If you are looking for a lead idea to kick start your Python business (and you have the resources to invest into marketing), this talk is for you.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Python general Business Use Case</tags></item><item><title>Industrial Machine Learning Pipelines with Python &amp; Airflow</title><author>Alejandro Saucedo</author><description>This talk will provide key insights on the learnings I have obtained throughout my career building &amp; deploying machine learning systems in critical environments across several sectors. I will provide a deep dive on how to build scalable and distributed machine learning data pipelines using Airflow with a Celery backend. I will also compare Airflow with other technologies available out there and how it differentiates, such as Luigi, Chronos, Pinball, etc. If you attend the talk, you will obtain an understanding on the solid fundamentals of Airflow, together with its caveats and walk-arounds for more complex use-cases. As we proceed with the examples, I will cover the challenges that you will run into when scaling Machine Learning systems, and how Airflow can be used to address these using a manager-worker-queue architecture for distributed processing with Celery.  By the end of this talk you will have the knowledge required to build your own industry-ready machine learning pipelines to process data at scale, and I will provide further reading resources so people are able to implement the knowledge obtained almost right away.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Deep Learning Machine-Learning Big Data Distributed Systems</tags></item><item><title>How to develop your project from an idea to architecture design in 50 minutes</title><author>Anastasiia Tymoshchuk</author><description>Have you ever asked yourself: - how and where to start developing a new project from the scratch, - how to choose main components of a new software or how to develop a new feature, - how to decide whether your project needs refactoring, - how to avoid repeating the same issues?

One big challenge is dealing with the compatibility of different tools and using these to create very complex adaptive, yet robust workflows in order to be able to guide cutting edge experiments e.g. predicting how well a small drug like molecule can bind to a protein that could serve as a target for a new drug. The talk will give a gentle introduction to what kind of python related tools are available in the field  of computational molecular biology, how they are used, and what kind of complex workflows scientist have to solve.
I will then introduce BioSimSpace an open source python library and flagship project of the CCPBioSim consortium in the UK, which provides a common API to avoid having to learn many individual tools facing compatibility and dependency challenges allowing scientists to focus on the scientific question at hand and not solving programming challenges. BioSimSpace allows fast and interoperable building of workflow components (nodes) for bimolecular problems, which can easily be used on a variety of different computational resources. In particular I will introduce the cloud facilities available for fast prototyping using a Jupyter notebook interface.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Scientific Libraries (Numpy/Pandas/SciKit/...)

I can see at least two cases when it’s a thing:
- introduction to programming - regardless an age and any previous educational experience,
- data science - it’s just a standard…
and actually both - you can teach a future data scientists starting by teaching Python. During this talk, I would like to briefly present you what Open Source Python educational materials do we have there and how those are and can be used to teach Python and data science. PyLadies, Django Girls, Django Carrots, Python Software Foundation creates many very available materials. From the data science side, you have Open Source materials created by kaggle, Minerva, Github repos, and many other organizations and individuals. During this talk you will learn:
- where to find an Open Source Python and data science tutorials and educational materials
- how does the Python community can support your learning process
- why learning data science with Python is a good idea. I’m also interested in learning your educational experience with an Open Source materials and Python community supporting your learning experience.

It was likely, for no one seemed to know web frameworks more familiarly; there was no framework so obscure that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He must have developed in everything, at least in the spirit.” We’ll start with the current crop of microframeworks, showing how to achieve the same task in each, before progressing to “Batteries included” and the more specialised async frameworks. For developers who perhaps have only used a single framework, this talk gives them an opportunity to get out and explore the world (of web frameworks) and broaden their horizons, with plenty of Jules Verne inspired fun along the way.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Fun and Humor Pyramid ASYNC / Concurreny Internet Django</tags></item><item><title>Hacking Reinforcement Learning</title><author>Guillem Duran</author><description>Repository Slides with notes Creating huge datasets of top performing examples for Reinforcement Learning (RL) has always been tricky, but if we allow
ourselves to cheat a bit it can be done very easily. During this talk, I will present a new family of algorithms that allow to efficiently generate very high quality samples for any known RL environment. This new generation of planning algorithms achieves a performance which is several orders of magnitude higher
than any other existing alternative, while offering linear time complexity and good scalability. This talk will be a practical example
of how we can use new tools for hacking any reinforcement learning environment, and make it generate superhuman level games. Hacking RL, as any other hacking process will be divided in four phases: During information gathering, I will briefly explain what are the main ideas behind Reinforcement Learning.
I will also talk about how our theory (FractalAI) came to be, and what are the fundamental concepts behind it. We will find an attack vector against the environment API, and explain how it can be exploited. I will explain
the fundamental concepts needed to build a new generation of exploits, that will allow us to have complete control over the data the environment produces. This is the time to test the new exploits and to show a proof of concept. We will exploit the attack vector to gain access
to the environment. Using only a laptop I will show how it is possible to sample data which surpasses human performance way faster than real time. Once we have gained control of the environment, we will measure how well the exploits work, and how well the techniques presented
can generalize to other types of environments. I want the talk to be as simple and fast as possible, with a lot of graphical examples, videos, and a Jupyter notebook.
The Q&amp;A session is the time to apply some social engineering to get me to talk about the details that you find more interesting.
I have prepared additional material covering the most common questions and concerns, but feel free to ask whatever you want, I love challenging questions ;) Some of the topics covered in the additional material are: Google spreadsheet with all bencharks on Atari Code used to run the examples .

This understanding can come from many different sources and techniques: domain expertise, exploratory analysis, SMEs, some specific Machine Learning techniques, and feature engineering.
As a matter of fact, most Machine Learning and Statistical analysis strongly depends on how the data is prepared, thus making feature engineering very important for any serious Machine Learning enterprise. “Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.” In this talk we will discuss what feature engineering  and feature selection are; how to select important features in a real-world dataset and how to develop a simple, but powerful ensemble to measure feature importance and perform feature selection. Familiarity with intermediate concepts of the Python programming language is required to follow the implementation steps. General knowledge of the basic concepts of Machine Learning and data cleaning will be useful, but not strictly necessary, to follow the discussion on feature selection and feature engineering.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Algorithms Data Science Data Python 3 Machine-Learning</tags></item><item><title>Extending Python with C/C++</title><author>Paul Ross</author><description>If you want your Python code to run really fast you can get dramatic performance improvements if you are willing to write some of your code in C/C++.

They are not only very motivating and rewarding, but also teach a very difficult kind of programming — real-time, interactive applications. In the process you also learn about graphics, sound, graphs, artificial intelligence, data structures and algorithms, not because someone tries to teach you, but simply because you actually need all this to make your game. Knowledge gained this way has its own unique quality.
Unfortunately, while Python is an excellent language for learning, it doesn’t make it easy to make games. The number of hoops you have to jump through for installing and configuring everything on every single computer on which you want to run your game makes it really hard to start, and even harder to show your creations to your friends.
To make things easier, I have built a number of devices dedicated to game development, which remove as many of the obstacles as possible to let you simply start on making your game, without distractions.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Gadgets Teaching Education Game-Development MicroPython</tags></item><item><title>Basic Data Science tools</title><author>Sarah Diot-Girard</author><description>The aim of this session is to help data scientists with little experience in Python : Set their environment development: install Python, Jupyter, set Virtualenv , install scientific libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy..

This year, I started working at European XFEL, a research facility built around a 3km long X-ray laser. Both projects use Python in their control systems, and despite the vastly different size and budget, they have surprisingly similar architectures, with separate processes sending data to each other using sockets. We wrote the code for our sailing boat using an open source framework called the Robot Operating System, or ROS. ROS is built around the concept of communicating nodes: a node can publish messages on a named topic, and any other nodes subscribed to that topic will receive the message. Our boat runs about 15 nodes (the precise number depends on what task it’s doing). This isn’t the only way to drive a robot boat: the team from Aberystwyth, whose code is also open, use a very different architecture. European XFEL, in Hamburg, is a new €1.2 billion collaboration between 12 countries. The control and data analysis systems are built on a framework called Karabo, developed in-house. Karabo ‘devices’ - which can encapsulate hardware interfaces or software processing - communicate using both a central message broker and point-to-point channels. I’ll describe each of these projects, and the similarities and differences between their software systems. Then I’ll talk about what has been good and bad on each project, and what patterns and ideas we can take from them for designing other systems, including systems that don’t control hardware.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Science Engineering Robotics Architecture Case Study</tags></item><item><title>Python and Raspberry Pi</title><author>Ben Nuttall</author><description>Explore physical computing and more using Python on Raspberry Pi The Raspberry Pi is a small affordable computer which runs a Debian-based operating system called Raspbian.

It seems that every major company has their own product in this space. Some have great features, others have great performance, so its very difficult to choose the right one. But what if you didn’t have to limit your choice to just one? What if you could use the most developer-friendly framework for designing a neural network, the most efficient framework for training and finally the lightest one for inference on edge devices? That’s the idea people at Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon were thinking about when they created the ONNX format. Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is a binary file format, based on Protocol Buffers, designed to store representations of neural networks. Networks are stored as computational graphs and the format supports saving both the network architecture and trained weighs. ONNX is an open standard and it’s gaining broad community support. Tools already exist for importing and exporting models from frameworks such as Caffe2, PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Apache MXNet, Chainer, TensorFlow, SciKit-Learn. ONNX support will be built directly into Windows and Apple’s CoreML. Runtimes exist for other environments such as servers and neural network accelerators (Intel’s nGraph), GPUs (NVIDIA’s TensorRT) and more. Other tools such as Netron and Visual DL allow you to visualize and inspect your ONNX models. My poster will describe the capabilities of ONNX and demonstrate them through code samples and screenshots.

However, the situation is now changing with digital data sources.

Studies can be done at different levels ranging from intracity to intercontinental trips. Do tourists and residents behave in the same way when in the same city? Are we prone to visit some cities if we have visited another one? What about train and private transport networks, do people from different countries show different patterns? Can we predict people fluxes between cities?

Difficulties with reproducibility, lack of the ability to prepare experiments quickly and dirty data are just three examples. Data science projects involve a lot of experimentation and quick adoption of new ideas and technologies. Such environment makes it difficult to keep the code clean as well as keep track of small changes that makes new experiment successful. Here, we use an instance segmentation challenge - called Mapping Challenge - hosted on the crowdAI platform to show: 1) our best practices when working in data science projects, 2) competition results. Our best practices involve usage of the steppy library, which provides minimal interface for building machine learning pipelines. Besides this, we organized our work in a transparent and open way, publishing code, tasks and experiments results. On the poster, we share our results regarding pre- and post-processing routines, network architectures and training scheme. We also present technology stack that we use. It is a blend of well established Python packages (like numpy and sklearn) and our own open source initiatives, that is steppy and steppy-toolkit. Poster is for Pythonists looking for: 1) example solution to the instance segmentation task, 2) ideas how to organize data science project.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Best Practice Data Science Clean Code Open-Source Machine-Learning</tags></item><item><title>Cloud-Agnostic Deployment of Distributed TensorFlow</title><author>Javier Jorge</author><description>In this poster we will see how to deploy the required infrastructure to create a TensorFlow cluster, and then provision the software to train the model.

Unfortunately, there is no such book available currently. In the meantime, we are all struggling on how to make our applications running in Docker… Because there is so many ways to do it, it’s often hard to find out what is the best way to do it. But with some practice, and many trials/errors, some patterns take shape. That’s what we will see during this training session. We will start by writing some tests for a web application with Pytest. Then, we will automate them with Tox. And to finish, we will run them in Docker Compose. Our development workflow will be managed with Invoke, and our goal will be to have tests independent of the running environment, so they can be run both locally or on a continuous integration server (e.g., GitLab with Kubernetes runners).

As of May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation affects how European residents can access and grant consent to use their data. As European data scientists, we now have an obligation as well as distinct motivation, to practice data science with attention to data privacy. In this workshop, we will introduce some of the basics in terms of defining privacy within the realm of data collection, modeling and machine learning. A focus on practical knowledge and code, we will cover how one can implement some of these algorithms with Python. Students will be presented with these theories along with recent research on privacy-preserving models, so they can leave with a better understanding of how to apply privacy principles to data science in their work and study.</description><date>Tuesday 24 July Tuesday 24 July</date><tags>Security Data Jupyter/iPython Machine-Learning Privacy</tags></item><item><title>Real-time transcription and sentiment analysis of audio streams</title><author>Aaron Bassett</author><description>In this training session, we’re going to learn how to create a virtual rapporteur.

Python has a number of features which are extremely powerful but, for some reason are not particularly well known in the community. This makes progressing in our Python knowledge quite hard after we reach an intermediate level. Fear not: this session has you covered! We will look at some advanced features of the Python language including properties,  class decorators, the descriptor protocol, annotations, data classes and meta-classes. If time allows we will even delve into the abstract syntax tree (AST) itself. We will use Python 3.7 and strongly recommend that attendees install a reasonably recent version of Python 3 to make the most out of the training.

This training will introduce Pandas (and Numpy) for people who either haven’t used them at all or are just getting started with them. It will then go on to introduce testing in Python (in general), with unittest, and testing analytical code, in particular, with the test-driven data analysis package. Planned content: Pandas and Numpy:
  - what they are
  - why you should used them
  - how to use them
  - basic numpy concepts (arrays, dtypes, array operations, zeros, ones, creating new arrays, where, choose, sum, size etc.)
  - pandas basics: DataFrames, creating DataFrames, loading data, indices
  - creating new columns, appending DataFrames, merging DataFrames, groupby operations, plotting.
  - loading and saving data (pickle; csv, feather) Testing
  - the idea of testing and test-driven development
  - the unittest library basics: unittest.TestCase, unittest.main, verbosity, self.assertEqual and friends.
  - slightly advanced unittest basics: setUp, tearDown, setUpClass, tearDownClass
  - unit tests vs. integration and system tests
  - pytest as an alternative to unittest Test-Driven Data Analysis:
  - making the case for testing analytical processes
  - extending the ideas from software testing to reference tests for analytical processes with ReferenceTestCase from the TDDA library
  - Using constraints to test data (input; output; intermediates).
       - Automatically generating constraints from known good data
       - Verifying data against generated (or hand-created) constraints 
       - Detecting bad data (and anomalies) PREPARATION: As a bare minumum, you will need a working Python (preferably 3.6 or 3.7, though 2.7 could be used) with numpy and pandas installed, preferably with JupyterLab. Anaconda is a great way to get all this. Ideally, you should also have installed the TDDA library, the feather library and the pmmif library in case the network is overloaded during training.

This approach focuses on documentation structure . Based on sound, well-established principles concerning a number of topics (including learning, understanding, praxis, pedagogy amongst others) it provides a documentation framework that is easy to understand, straightforward to put into practice, and above all, immediately and enduringly effective. In the workshop we’ll use a hypothetical documentation set for examples, but attendees should have some actual documentation - whether already extant or in the planning phase - to apply it. The principles used in this workshop are outlined at https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/. This work has been presented in numerous conference talks, such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg.

The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. The tight integration of all three languages makes it possible to freely mix Python features like generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the same code. This tutorial by a core developer introduces the Cython compiler by interactive code examples, and shows how you can make it generate fast binary modules that talk to native libraries, as easily as Python itself. Attendees should make sure they have a C compiler installed and configured to build binary Packages for CPython. We will use CPython 3.6/7, although all examples can also be followed with CPython 2.7. If you’re not on Linux, I recomment using a conda environment with gcc.

While it is possible to write Python programs without active knowledge of them, knowing more about them facilitates a deeper understanding of the language. With examples, you will learn how they work and how to write your own descriptors and metaclasses. Furthermore, you will understand when to use and when better not to use them. This tutorial is a systematic introduction to descriptors and metaclasses. It covers all relevant information with a focus on practical applications for common tasks. In hand-on sessions you will learn how to write your own descriptors that adapt attribute access to your needs. You will experience how metaclasses can help you to get more insight into a code base. Use cases provide working code that can serve as a basis for your own solutions. You will gain a deeper understanding of more advanced concepts that can help to write better programs. The training is designed for Python 3 (3.6+ preferred). Most of the material will work with Python 2.7, sometimes requiring minor modifications. I will use  a Jupyter Notebook in [Jupyterlab] ( https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) in the training. I encourage you to try them out. Otherwise any editor, IDE, or interactive Python environment your prefer works. No other 3rd party libraries to install. Please download the course material .
I’ve been delivering these topics over the last years as a part of numerous advanced corporate trainings and open courses as well as trainings at PyCon US, EuroPython, PyCon PL, PyCon DE, and PyCon IE.

If you already have had experience with containers and/or Kubernetes, you likely not get much out of this training. While not required, if you want to follow along, please follow this link below to set your environment up: requirements Containers have more or less taken over the world of application, web APIs, mobile endpoints and other forms of deployment. They have become the currency, the “table stakes” and de-facto application deployment unit. Their raise to the fore has brought about a whole host of use cases which weren’t practical or accessible in the world of “classic” paradigms of infrastructure and virtualization. Containers have also brought application deployment closer and more accessible to developers. But as more use cases, deployment styles and exponential adoption of containers was ongoing, a new set of problems began to surface: how do you manage the ever growing number of containers in a deployment? How do you make sure containers have the right resources, deployed to the right machine, running with the correct parameters, how do you scale in and out without disruption? How do you make sure in a fleet of X containers that they’re all running and in healthy state? Enter Kubernetes. The goal of this course is to give the attendees a solid foundation of the core concepts mentioned above both in theory and hand-on practice using docker, kubernetes and friends to deploy a sample multi-tier python web application. All attendees need is a laptop with minikube installed and an Internet connection. Full course outline and abstract (because character limit) here .

It is less widely appreciated that writing good error messages is also a skill that must be learnt.
This talk is in two parts. 
The first covers the commonest error message gaffes:
•   Insufficiently explicit messages.
•   Issuing the same message for two different conditions.
•   Suppressing the stack trace.
•   Polluting the stack trace.
The second part describes a way to ensure usable, actionable error messages, even when the writer of the message is not a professional coder. This was developed for an environment where superusers code up most of the dozens of data validation rules and the accompanying messages, and the application in which Python is embedded suppresses the stack trace.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Python general Programming</tags></item><item><title>When to use Machine Learning: Tips, Tricks and Warnings</title><author>Pascal van Kooten</author><description>Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning in particular, is one of the hottest topics in tech/business.

However there is a strong temptation to start with the user interface and add the business logic to it some methodologies emphasize this with the process of prototyping the (G)UI first. The danger is that your business logic code can get too entangled with the UI and a change of platform or framework becomes almost impossible. This presentation will show how to maintain a clear separation between the Business Logic and the User Interface by starting with a command line interface using argparse and growing a GUI on top. We will cover:
 - Why maintain the seperation
 - Using argparse
 - Adding a GUI layer with wxPython
 - Automating the GUI generation
 - Adding a web interface
 - Testing advantages of this approach
 - Scripting advantages
 - Some packaging models.

There are tens of billions of microcontrollers in world: they are everywhere from watches to cars. Developers program them mostly in C, since their tiny hardware resources make it very hard to use higher-level langauges such as Python. In 2014 the MicroPython project was started with the goal of making it possible to program microcontrollers in Python. Was it hard to make Python work on a device with only 16 KB of RAM? Is MicroPython a Python dialect or is it a different language? I’ll start with the most important optimizations and the key differences in the language implementation to give you an idea of what MicroPython really is. Most of us are not contributors to MicroPython though and it’s much more important for us to understand how Python coding for microcontrollers is different from, say, web development or scripting. What do you need to learn in order to program your mictrocontroller-based IoT devices?

It uses various
techniques to store data in a CPU and I/O efficient way like row groups,
compression for pages in column chunks or dictionary encoding for columns.
Index hints and statistics to quickly skip over chunks of irrelevant data
enable efficient queries on large amount of data. Apache Parquet files can be read into Pandas DataFrames with the two libraries
fastparquet and Apache Arrow. While Pandas is mostly used to work with data
that fits into memory, Apache Dask allows us to work with data larger then memory
and even larger than local disk space. Data can be split up into partitions
and stored in cloud object storage systems like Amazon S3 or Azure Storage. Using Metadata from the partiton filenames, parquet column statistics and
dictonary filtering allows faster performance for selective queries without
reading all data. This talk will show how use partitioning, row group skipping 
and general data layout to speed up queries on large amount of data.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>python Scientific Libraries (Numpy/Pandas/SciKit/...)

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a design pattern that helps produce more performance and resilience in applications where data access is intense.
In this talk, we will understand when to use and the problems that CQRS solves. We will also apply CQRS in a Python application using the Nameko framework. The outline talk is:
        ○ (4 minutes) - Present a real problem of a web application, when creating new instances is not a solution, because the database receives an overwrite of writing and unfeasible to read the data, collapsing the application. 
        ○ (6 minutes) - Present the CQRS pattern conceptually and how this design pattern solves this type of problem using the structure of Command Stack and Query Stack

These neural nets are widely used in recognizing patterns in sequences of data, like numerical timer series data, images, handwritten text, spoken words, genome sequences, and much more. Since these nets possess memory, there is a certain analogy that we can make to the human brain in order to learn how RNNs work. RNNs can be thought of as a network of neurons with feedback connections, unlike feedforward connections which exist in other types of Artificial Neural Networks. The flow of talk will be as follows: - Self Introduction - Introduction to Deep Learning - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - Diving DEEP into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - Comparing Feedforward Networks with Feedback Networks - Quick walkthrough: Implementing RNNs using Python (Keras) - Understanding Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Vanishing Gradient Problem - Towards more sophisticated RNNs: Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)/Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) - End of talk - Questions and Answers Session</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Visualization Data Science Developing with Python Track Machine-Learning Deep Learning</tags></item><item><title>Type annotations with larger codebases</title><author>Stephan Jaensch</author><description>You’ve heard about type annotations, you know they help reduce bugs and improve documentation especially for large codebases, and you’ve attended an introductory talk or read a tutorial about using them. But how do you get started using them with your big, existing codebase? How do you make sure your colleagues will be annotating new code they write - or existing code they’re changing? And how do you get around some of the issues you might run into when using the still-beta type checker mypy on your codebase? This talk will start where the typical introductory Python type annotation talks end and discuss the real-world challenges when starting to annotate types with an existing codebase of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code. I’ll walk you through best practices learned from doing just that at Yelp, telling you about some of the roadblocks we hit (and how we got past them). We’ll also take a look at:
- how you can get the most out of type annotations even with non-annotated third-party libraries
- how to deal with code patterns that currently don’t always work well with annotations
- when the only way to get proper type checking is through refactoring your code.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Type-Hinting Python 3</tags></item><item><title>Trio: A pythonic way to do async programming</title><author>Emmanuel Leblond</author><description>Concurrent programs are super useful: think of web apps juggling lots
of simultaneous downloads and websocket connections, chat bots
tracking multiple concurrent conversations, or web spiders fetching
pages in parallel. But writing concurrent programs is complicated,
intimidating to newcomers, and often challenging even for experts. Does it have to be? Python is famous for being simple and
straightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and
straightforward too?
Trio is an attempt to address this question by the positive ! By taking advantage of new Python 3 features (async/await keywords,
async loops and context managers etc.) while dropping legacy concepts that
older asynchronous frameworks has to maintain, Trio defines a new set of
primitives that make it dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs. In this talk, we will describe those primitives, and demonstrate how to
use them to implement a basic algorithm for speeding up TCP connections.
Compared to the best previous Python implementation, our version turns out to
be easier to understand, more correct, and dramatically shorter.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Open-Source Programming ASYNC / Concurreny Architecture</tags></item><item><title>The Web is Terrifying! Using the PyData stack to spy on the spies.</title><author>Sarah Bird</author><description>We all know the internet can be a scary place. In this talk I’ll focus on two ways I’ve found it positively terrifying. First, digging into tracking technologies, I have learned about the breadth and depth of ways our online activity is monitored, stored, and repackaged. Second, when starting out to learn a new skill, the tidal wave of information available online can be overwhelming. Using the PyData stack to explore and visualize different data sources, including a new dataset from Mozilla, we’ll examine some of the many types of online tracking. My goal is to leave the audience with: 1) A sense of the breadth of tools in the PyData toolbox that can be applied to a real-world analysis
  2) An understanding of a few methods of online tracking so they can be more informed internet citizens In particular, now that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has come into force, we can explore the data in light of EU citizens’ new rights, and the new responsibilities of companies worldwide. Along the way, I’ll also talk about becoming a software engineer, then a builder of data science tools, and my new journey into data science. Being self-taught can be, lonely, scary, and full of embarrassing pitfalls. I’ll share some stories about my learning journey, and the people and resources that have supported me.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Visualization Data Science Data Web Crawling Privacy</tags></item><item><title>Trust me, I'm a Data Scientist - ethics for builders of data-based applications</title><author>Sarah Diot-Girard</author><description>Data Science is gonna save the world, right? Or is it? 
Machine Learning epic fails are being largely commented. It’s easy to convince ourselves that they are due to the inconsiderate misuse of Data Science. But is it really so? Is it possible that innocuous choices lead an honnest team to a disaster? During the course of this talk, we will build together an (imaginary) application: a disruptive AI-based smart virtual assistant, pledging to help high-schoolers with their university choice. We will see how unintended biaises may creep in at every step, even with the best of intentions. We will explore different topics, such as algorithmic fairness, model interpretability and the handling of minority classes. Through this practical example, this talk will present a review of major ethical pitfalls identified in the Machine Learning community along with suggestions on how to avoid them. This talk is intended for beginner to intermediate Data Scientists, and people working with Data Scientists, even without specific technical knowledge.

Thanks to its versatility, Python’s usage and adoption has changed a lot over the last decade to go beyond the very act of software programming. From Developers to SysOps, closely followed by Scientists and Data analysts, Python has spread to become a common tongue for a wide range of people. We will start by looking at how this increased adoption impacted Python ecosystem and is still shaping it today. While this talk is not walk through all the Python technologies around data , some of them will be outlined so you will hear words like Numpy, Pandas or Jupyter. Then we will try to project ourselves in the future and by highlighting the pitfalls Python has to overcome to keep up with its pace and mature in its ability to scale !

Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that creates projects from templates. It is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of a permissive BSD-3 license. With around 180 individual contributors, more than 1000 public templates on GitHub alone, and multiple talks at conferences, it is fair to say that there is a small community around it. But who are the people behind the project and what is it that they are doing? It’s been three years since I was granted the commit bit by the core team. I have learned a lot about FOSS communities and also about myself. At times I struggle with balancing my day job as a full-time Software Engineer and maintaining Cookiecutter and other FOSS projects in my spare time. By now I’m OK with not responding to issues immediately and closing pull requests. However it took me quite a while to get to this point. Maintaining FOSS projects can be incredibly rewarding and fun, but it can also be quite frustrating. It involves so much more than writing code or merging PRs, and yet sometimes it feels like that’s what most people think. The goal of this talk is to start a conversation around this topic and hear what other EuroPython attendees think about it and their challenges as contributors or maintainers.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Open-Source Community</tags></item><item><title>The naïve programmer</title><author>Daniele Procida</author><description>Since Picasso encountered Henri Rousseau over a century ago, modern art has been acutely aware of the value of the contributions that the naïve artist can make. Art negotiates the relationship between sophistication and naïvety with care and intelligence. What does our programming culture make of the naïve programmer?  What can programming gain or learn from this encounter? The naïve programmer is simply an unsophisticated programmer. Nobody is born sophisticated. Even the most sophisticated programmers were once naïve programmers. What’s more, the adoption of programming simply as a tool to solve immediate problems, by ever more people without any formal training, means that the number of naïve programmers will become greater, not less. Are we ready for this? This talk will explore the relationship, illuminating it with examples from the world of painting, art and music, and will offer some lessons that our own industry and culture should be ready to learn from.

Many things are more interesting than office file formats like DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and PDF. Still, while working with office formats does not seem to be the most fun, it is useful. But we can do better than just useful. With the Python and some great libraries, it is possible to have Python do much of the work you would have to do otherwise: In this talk, we will have a look at a usual working day for Bob and Ann, two fictional office works. Both Bob and Ann work office jobs, but while Bob does all of his work by hand, but Ann knows Python. We will look at different tasks that Bob wants to do, such as preparing an Excel report, building a Powerpoint presentation, or rearranging a PDF. Then, we will look how Ann use Python and some exciting libraries to automate these task. During the talk, we will use Bob and Ann to consider different task related to office file formats. We will then look at the Python libraries that are available. Then, using this library, we will see how an otherwise boring task can be automated. 
The goal of the task is to showcase the libraries to Python offers to work with standard office formats and provide you with a starting point for your own office automation. After this talk, you will know how to automate at least some of your daily office tasks. You may also be bored because Python is doing so much of your work for you.  If you know basic Python programming, you will be right at home. There will be some use of Pandas,  but it is not required.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Python general Python 3</tags></item><item><title>Standardize Testing in Python</title><author>Bernat Gabor</author><description>In this talk, Bernat will introduce tox, an open source tool with the bold vision of standardizing testing. From a CIs point of view, testing contains much more than just unit and/or integration tests; other things like code style checks, packaging, testing under various versions of Python, and checking that documentation still generates, are just as important. Things quickly start to spiral out of control once you add into the mix that there are many tools and ways to accomplish each of these tasks. In this talk, we will learn how tox tries to abstract away all this complexity, how to easily run CI tests on your local machine, and how one can use this tool inside your CI frameworks to ensure high quality and easily maintainable packages.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Agile Testing Python general Open-Source</tags></item><item><title>System testing with Pytest, Docker, and Flask</title><author>Neil Gall</author><description>The composability of fixtures in pytest is an improvement over traditional
xUnit setup/teardown, reducing the incentive to commit testing crimes such as
multi-stage and stepwise tests. This is great out of the box for unit tests,
but I’m going to show how to combine the power of pytest fixtures with Docker
to build high-level integration tests for microservices or other complex
systems with multiple components. I’ll then build on that to show how to embed
mock web services written with Flask right into the test code. With a sample Java application that makes use of some external resources to
offer a data processing service I’ll first quick an overview of Pytest, Docker,
and Flask. Then I’ll mix some pre-built code with live test coding to
demonstrate how to build high-level system tests which spin up the application
and its dependencies in Docker. I’ll then mock one of the external dependencies
using Flask, allowing the test to control and verify interaction between the
system components. Finally I’ll show how to wrap the Flask application in a
WSGI middleware that lets the test inspect interaction with the mocked service. From a learning and development point of view, building your own is better than
re-using someone else’s code so I’ll show how the support code for these
features is relatively simple and how the audience can build it themselves to
exactly meet their own needs. And I’ll do it all with a sense of fun, a joke
or two and maybe a little storytelling.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>python Docker Test Libraries (pyTest/node/...)

Do you know what happens if any of your system’s dependency will start failing? Do you even know what exactly each part of your system does or did any time in the past? Or how fast you will identify root of the problem in case your system goes down at 2am? The talk focuses on distributed systems (microservices, APIs that communicate with databases, memory, third party services, etc.), monitoring, their failures and recovery in order to help you answer yourself questions above. First part aims on importance of monitoring such systems on several levels - monitoring of hardware, application monitoring, monitoring from outside of the systems, detecting malfunctions based on anomalies within system’s data flows. Second part presents several standard techniques for preventing system failure in case of outage of dependency and technique how to recover from inconsistent state after outage. Content of presentation is helpful and interesting for beginners and intermediates. Senior developers and developers working on reliable distributed systems should bear in mind content of this presentation and master shown techniques.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Best Practice Microservices Engineering Architecture failures/mistakes</tags></item><item><title>SSLError, now what?</title><author>Christian Heimes</author><description>TLS/SSL is the most important and widely-used protocol for secure and encrypted communication, e.g. HTTPS. It offers more than just encryption. TLS also ensures data integrity and strong authentication with X.509 certificates. But it provides merely a false sense of security, if you use it wrong. Have you ever encountered ssl.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE VERIFY FAILED], while connecting to a server, but you didn’t understand what is going on? Are you running production code without TLS/SSL protection or with certificate validation disabled, because you couldn’t figure out how to make it work correctly?

It could be a convenient way for Python programs and distributed systems to communicate. Unfortunately pickle is widely considered to be unsafe, and it has lead to several vulnerabilities over the years. As the Python manual warns The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously 
  constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted
  or unauthenticated source. Does this have to be the case? Can we use Pickle safely? This talk will be a deep dive into what an attacker can do with a maliciously constructed pickles. I’ll show what defences you can implement against the common attacks, especially those that gain arbitrary code execution. I will present new research into other attacks, and mitigations. Finally I will review a few less known alternatives to pickle.

As such, it is a prime candidate for replacing C for writing Python modules that have to be fast or that have to interact with other native code. Rust is extremely fast and makes it very hard to get concurrency wrong. Many ways of making Python call into lower level have appeared over the years such as CFFI, ctypes, boost.python, cython, SWIG. All of them are cumbersome in their own ways. PyO3 is a Rust library that makes it easy and simple to write native Python modules with minimal glue code and no crazy tooling required. It even works cross-platform without problems. The talk shows some sample code of PyO3-based modules and compares it with the code of the alternatives as well as the alternative’s cross-platform support and tooling. The goal is for the audience to be informed about a new safe and modern way of writing native Python modules. The audience doesn’t need any prerequisites except for a healthy interest in native code and Python modules. C knowledge is optional.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Performance Python general All Other Programming Languages C-Languages Compiler and Interpreters</tags></item><item><title>Recipe for text analysis in social media:</title><author>Eulalia Veny</author><description>The analysis of text data in social media is gaining more and more importance every day. The need for companies to know what people think and want is key to invest money in providing customers what they want. The first approach to text analysis was mainly statistical, but adding linguistic information has been proven to work well for improving the results. One of the problems that you need to address when analyzing social media is time. People are constantly exchanging information, users write comments every day about what they think of a product, what they do or the places they visit. It is difficult to keep track of everything that happens. Moreover, information is sometimes expressed in short sentences, keywords, or isolated ideas, such as in Tweets. Language is usually unstructured because it is composed of isolated ideas, or without context. I will talk about the problem of text analysis in social media. I will also explain briefly Naïve Bayes classifiers, and how you can easily take advantage of them to analyse sentiment in social media, and I will use an example to show how linguistic information can help improve the results. I will also evaluate the pros and cons of supervised vs unsupervised learning. Finally, I will introduce opinion lexicons, both dictionary based and corpus-based, and how lexicons can be used in semi-supervised learning and supervised learning.

Alternatively, you could come to a talk that will demonstrate the basics of recursion, using fractals drawn by the python turtle module! What are fractals? Fractals are psychedelic designs that appear basically the same regardless of scale. They also appear all over nature–consider how a tree trunk and branches is similar in structure to branches and twigs or how a wave is made of mini waves. Best of all, fractals can be constructed using recursive functions. What is the turtle module? It is part of the standard python library that can be used to draw amazing things and is commonly used as a tool for learning to code. Come for the recursion, stay for the amazing fractals, and leave knowing that no turtles were harmed in the making of this talk. This talk is suitable for all python enthusiasts. Those who love mathematics will love this talk. Advanced developers will learn more about a tool that can be used to teach people to code.

Or they would be, if they were true.
Despite community perception, more than half of Python usage still happens on Windows, including web development, system administration, and data science, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works the same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using. Still, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their potential audience by not even attempting to be compatible.
This session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform libraries. From simple things like using pathlib rather than bytestrings, through to all the ways you can get builds and tests running on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will have a checklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable the whole Python world to benefit from your work.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Windows Best Practice CPython Cross-Platform-Development</tags></item><item><title>Pythonic code vs. performance</title><author>Łukasz Kąkol</author><description>Idiomatic Python is beautiful.

I’ll also be talking about some of the tooling that can be used to provide consumers and developers working on your API with a great development experience. Next I’ll cover some ways you can use these tools to empower your development process and get you developing ‘API First’.

Drag your old code into the modern age.</title><author>Becky Smith</author><description>The clock is ticking on Python 2.7, with support to be dropped in January 2020.  With major dependencies such as Django, NumPy and pandas moving to Python 3 only, the time has come for even big established codebases to consider upgrading.  Many organisations are still postponing for various reasons; we will attempt to demonstrate that with a bit of planning and perseverance, and the assistance of some handy tools, we can embrace the future! This session will provide a first-hand perspective on how we upgraded a large (~65,000 lines of python code) 8-year-old Django project with multiple external dependencies from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6. We will briefly discuss the benefits of upgrading to Python 3, and architectural considerations.  The session will primarily focus on the practicalities of upgrading the code itself.  We will not try to provide a single “best” solution for upgrading to Python 3, but rather will introduce some of the available tools, provide an insight into how we used them, and their advantages and disadvantages from our experience.  We will discuss preparatory steps and approaches, strategies for dealing with external dependencies, and “gotchas” that we encountered during the process. The aim of this session is to provide an example of how a Python 3 upgrade on an established commercial product can be successfully completed, and to furnish audience members with a set of tools and strategies to help them with their own projects.

The system and the requirements of the client grows everyday (like in every other project these days). I’ve convinced that the effort we put in making each of these tests pays off daily. Speaking with other Django and Python developers I’ve noticed that people often “overengineer” their unit tests and they usually tend to break their principles. In this presentation I will talk mainly about unit tests. - what packages we use and how and when to use them (properly). We will take a look on how we structure our projects and how this structure actually helps us write proper unit tests. I will start with the very basic tests and continue with the mocking technique. In the end I’m going to refer to other testing methods (integration, E2E, validation testing,  visual regression, etc.). The goal of this talk is to make people better in testing and to show them how these skills will fasten the development process and  help them maintain their project and it’s quality.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Django clients Testing APIs</tags></item><item><title>Programming paradigms for physical computing and IoT</title><author>Ben Nuttall</author><description>A look at the GPIO Zero library for Raspberry Pi yields the blueprint for a Pythonic API for programming the behaviour of interconnected devices.

And there are a lot of python tools that allow you to hack together a notebook to quickly get insight on your data, or train a model to predict, or classify. Or you might have inherited some data wrangling and modeling {Jupyter/Zeppelin} notebook code from someone else, like the resident data scientist. The code works on test data, when you run the cells in the right order (skipping cell 22), and you believe that the insight gained from this work would be a valuable game changer. But now how do you take this experimental code into production, and keep it up-to-date with a regular retraining schedule? And what do you need to do after that, to ensure that it remains reliable and brings value in the long term? These will be the questions this talk will answer, focusing on 2 main themes:
     1. What does running an ML model in production involve?
     2. How to improve your development workflow to make the path to production easier?

Let’s talk about functions, methods, callables and closures - what they are, what you can give them, what they can give you, what you can do with them … and what’s inside. You probably think you already know everything about functions, but you probably don’t! Input &amp; Output : How do you get things in and out of functions? I’ll cover parameters and the myriad of ways they can be specified, provided and accessed - including helpful hints to avoid common mistakes! I’ll cover return values, briefly, along with variable scopes and exceptions. Closures : What are they, how do they work and how they can affect memory usage. Methods : How does a method differ from a function, when are they made, how do they work (where does self come from?) and how to access the function inside every method. __magic__ :Make your own callables from any object! Introspection : Using modern Python techniques, what can you find out about a function, and what can you do with that information? Bytecode : What happens if you open up a function and look at its insides? Can you change it and put it back together again? (Spoiler: Yes, you can.) By the end of this talk, I guarantee* you’ll know more about callables than when you walked in, along with techniques both practical and so extreme your colleagues will never let you merge them to master.

Or what the differences are between them and when one should be used instead of another? We will take a deep look into these concepts, what they mean and examples on how to use/create them in Python. In this talk, we will quickly explore the reasons for using mock and how it works, quickly jumping into the different concepts of testing doubles and how they can be used in Python. The talk will include as part of the examples from some features in mock coming in Python 3.7 that might change how usual mocking is performed. The talk builds on the writings of Gerard Meszaros and Martin Fowler about testing doubles, focusing on how to apply them to Python. This session, which will review test isolation concepts and the unittest.mock module, is structured in a way that both beginners and intermediate developers will learn from it. A basic knowledge of testing is recommended. Intermediate developers will leave the room with a clear understanding of the tools - further than just using simple mocks - to successfully fake dependencies. Multiple “not so well known” features of unittest.mock will be presented so we can shape those objects to behave functionally different.
Unittest.mock is an extremely useful library which is commonly underused, this talk aims to bring clarity into stubbing in general and into medium/advanced mock features to ease and remove pain when users work with it. Outline: • Intro (1’)

Function as a Service (FaaS) platforms give us new ways to attack old problems. The possibility of executing functions as a service allows designing scalable and highly parallel applications, but on the other hand, this kind of applications require a particular programming style. For example, bundling dependencies and managing state is not trivial. However, there are plenty of tools and frameworks to help you code serverless applications with Python, and once you get started it is not complicated. In this talk we will mention the advantages of Serverless and we will focus on the situations in which we can introduce it into our Python projects. We will use AWS Lambda for the examples.

The technique of machine generated test inputs is an established testing approach and is sometimes referred to as fuzzing. I will take this idea further by presenting how various types of machine learning can provide novel outlier test cases to harden software and networks in a way that is superior to using only randomness. Instead, I will discuss how to train neural networks to produce better fuzzing data.This is a natural progression from my work with machine learning and image processing using support vector machines (SVM) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) which I have applied to this new domain of software testing.

WASM is primarily intended to run code in browsers, but its by no means limited to this. This makes it an interesting intermediate language (IR); code that compiles to WASM will (in the future) run basically anywhere. In short: WASM is coming and its great! Unsurprisingly, WASM is being embraced by many communities, such as C++, Rust, Lua, and .NET. Sadly, there does not seem to be a lot of enthusiasm from the Python community yet… Perhaps this is because Python is interpreted and can therefore not (easily) use WASM as a compilation target. It should be possible to compile a Python interpreter (like CPython or Pypy) to WASM and thereby run Python code in a browser. But the result would be pretty heavy-weight, so it would arguably not be a very practical. Within the PPCI project (a pure Python compiler infrastructure) tooling has been developed to load, inspect, compile and even run WASM modules. This allows combining WASM and Python in new ways. In this talk we discuss two approaches by which the Python community might embrace WASM. Firstly, various projects already exist that compile Python functions to other languages (e.g. Numba, PScript), and we have type annotations. If Python functions would be compiled to WASM, the resulting code would run in any WASM runtime (e.g. the browser). This will be demonstrated with an example, for which the resulting code can be run either in a browser or inside Python itself. In either case, it’s pretty darn fast. Secondly, rather than using WASM, it might be interesting for Python to function as a platform to run and bind WASM modules. Two of Python’s greater strengths are its rich ecosystem and its ability to glue things together. Let’s build on that! Imagine creating an application that consists of multiple WASM modules, perhaps compiled from different languages, and binding these together into a single Python app. This will be demonstrated with a game, which is written in Rust, compiled to WASM, and running inside a Python process. The WASM module consumes a drawing API, which is in this case provided by Python, and Python feeds the WASM module with user input. I hope that this talk inspires other Pythonistas to think about the advantages that WASM can bring to our ecosystem, and also about the role that Python can play in the growing WASM ecosystem.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Web All Other Programming Languages Community</tags></item><item><title>Let’s Build a Python Profiler in 25 LOC</title><author>Noam Elfanbaum</author><description>A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed.

But how does iteration in Python actually work “under the hood”? The words “iterator” and “iterable” each occur over 500 times in the Python documentation, but what does an iterator actually do , as opposed to an iterable? And how do they do it? Learn the details as we turn the iteration protocol inside out, with live coded demonstrations along the way. This talk will start from the way Python iterates of over a sequence, in comparison with iterating by index, like C. The key point of iterating over a sequence is that something needs to track which item in the sequence is next, which is something that Python’s  iteration protocol manages. The iterable section will demonstrate creating a simple object that returns items by index (e.g., a fibonacci series), showing that getitem is really all you need for an iterable, since an iterator is created for such objects when iterated upon. BUT, this doesn’t answer the question of how Python keeps track of which item is next. The iterator section answers that question by converting the iterable just created to an iterator - adding iter and next methods and showing how the iterator saves state and essentially drives the iteration protocol. Having an accurate understanding of iteration protocol will help developing Pythonistas reason better about both iterating over existing objects and creating their own iterables and iterators.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Python general Programming Python 2 Python 3</tags></item><item><title>Is your code tainted? Finding security vulnerabilities using taint-tracking.</title><author>Mark Shannon</author><description>“Taint tracking” is a technique used in code analysis to find security vulnerabilities and other problems. Any data that comes from an untrusted source, for example a HTTP request, is treated as “tainted”.
If that “tainted” data is able to reach a vulnerable part of your code, then you have a problem.
Sophisticated code analysis tools can track this data, and reveal potential security problems.
Examples of the sort of problem that can be found include  cross-site scripting (XSS), code injection, SQL injection and others. In this talk I will show how taint tracking analysis works in practice, introducing the concepts of source, sink and sanitizer.
I will then demonstrate using taint tracking to find a XSS vulnerability in a django app.
(We will chose a project that is designed to teach django security, where the vulnerability is deliberate.) I will also explain how thinking in terms of “taint” can help you write safer code,
even without access to code analysis. During this talk I will use the code analysis tools on lgtm.com to demonstrate the analysis.

Dropbox was an early adopter of type checking and mypy, and we’ve been gradually adding type annotations to our large production codebases since 2016. Engineers love how type annotations improve the clarity of code, and how mypy can surface hard-to-find bugs. We’ve learned a lot in the process of annotating millions of lines of code, and in this talk you’ll learn battle-tested approaches for adding type checking to an existing codebase.

Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may compare them character by character and have an idea of how many characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is never straight forward though, the definition of how “difference” of two names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant names, matching of words like “cafe” “bar” and “restaurant” are consider less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we consider company names that matches partly (like “Happy Unicorn company” and Happy Unicorn co.”) are the same? In the first half of the talk Levenshtein Distance, a measure of the similarity between two strings, will be explained. Different functions in Fuzzywuzzy like “partial ratio” and “token sort_ratio” will also be explored and compared for difference. It is very important to understand our tool and choose the right one for our task. Then in the second half, we will start tackling the example problem: matching company names, we will show that besides using Fuzzywuzzy, we have to also handle problem like finding and avoid matching of common words and speeding up the matching process by grouping the names. By combining all tricks and techniques that we demonstrate, we will also evaluate how efficient this method is and the advantage of using this method. This talk is for people in all level of Python experience who would like to learn a trick or two and would like to be able to solve similar problems in the future. Theory of how the library works will be explained and It is easy to be pick up even for beginners.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Beginners Case Study Data Open-Source Natural Language Processing</tags></item><item><title>Faster Python startup</title><author>Jeethu Rao</author><description>The cPython’s startup speed generally quite fast compared to other similar dynamic language interpreters. Despite this, the interpreter’s startup time increases linearly with the number and size of imported python modules. Although interpreter startup speed isn’t a significant concern in long running servers, it does matter for the command line and other frequently launched applications. One of the oldest tricks in the book, when it comes to performance optimizations is to perform frequent and expensive operations fewer times and reuse results from previous invocations. We noticed that the overhead of reading and un-marshalling .pyc files at startup can be eliminated if we could directly embed code objects and their associated object graph from .pyc files into the data segment of the cPython binary. This technique is quite similar to the approach taken by image based languages like Smalltalk in the past. Implementing this for cPython is made simpler because marshaled code objects in .pyc files contain a subset of the types of objects that marshal format supports. With this approach, loading a module included in the python binary is as cheap as dereferencing a pointer, albeit at the cost of increased binary size. This talk will discuss the approach taken to implement the aforementioned idea for Python 3.6 and the challenges faced in implementing it. It will also talk about benchmark results from the improvements and possible future directions for this work. Although this talk delves into cPython internals, no prior experience with cPython internals is required to follow along.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Performance Compiler and Interpreters CPython</tags></item><item><title>From linear algebra to machine learning</title><author>Omar Gutiérrez</author><description>Math is a crucial skill for people who are interested in Data Science and Machine Learning.

This data flow transforms a common and, in general, tedious task such as accounting into an interesting big data engineering problem. At Smarkets, accounting reports serve two main purposes: housekeeping of our financial operations and documentation for the relevant regulation authorities. In both cases, reliability and accuracy are crucial in the final result. The fact that these reports are generated daily, the need to cope with failure when retrieving data from previous days, and the fast growing transaction volume obsoleted the original accounting system and required a new pipeline that could scale. This talk presents the ETL pipeline designed to meet the constraints highlighted above, and explains the motivations behind the tech stack chosen for the job, which includes Python3, Luigi and Spark among others. These topics will be covered by describing the main technical problems solved with our design:
- Fault tolerance and reliability, i.e ability to identify faulty steps and only rerun those instead of the whole pipeline.
- Fast input/output.

Attendees should be fully comfortable with Python syntax and semantics, but familiarity with the ast module itself will not be necessary. The talk will begin with a conceptual overview of ASTs, including a brief look at Python’s built-in introspection capabilities. It will introduce tools for AST visualization (astor, showast, python-ast-explorer), creation (asttools, meta), and transformation to source code (codegen). How the AST can be used for static analysis will be covered; this will include discussion of Python’s built-in facilities (NodeVisitor) as well as of the 3rd party tools astsearch, astpath, and bellybutton. The talk will demonstrate the advantages and limits of these tools in comparison to other static analysis tooling (pylint, mypy); particular attention will be paid to how these tools can be incorporated into attendees’ workflows and  existing codebases and projects. Tooling for Python AST manipulation and metaprogramming will be the final topic covered, focusing on the use of the NodeTransformer built-in. The talk will cover practical applications and examples of metaprogramming, such as metaprogramming for DSLS (pony, xpyth), runtime code manipulation (patterns, yield-from), and others (e.g. assertion rewriting in pytest). While the talk will touch only briefly on each of the applications discussed, by the end of the session attendees should have a firm grasp of the kinds of problems the AST can be used to solve, what existing AST tooling can accomplish, and what resources are available for the development of their own AST tools.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Use Case Python general Tooling Code Analysis Static Analysis</tags></item><item><title>JavaScript for Python Developers</title><author>Žan Anderle</author><description>Having a hard time keeping track of where the modern JavaScript is going?

But as we add new features, as our dev team grows &amp; the software needs to be stable on production, things can get quite messy. We are going to look at some common patterns, derived from experience, on how to structure your Django project for scale and longevity. Main topics are: We are going to talk about when to rely on existing abstraction so it’s actually helpful &amp; when to avoid existing abstraction, and code things ourselves. The examples showed in this talk are derived from working with Django in the last 5 years on projects with: Key takeaways from the talk: The talk is great for all levels of Django knowledge - from beginners to advanced users &amp; teams. The main way of getting the point across is going to be by showing regular code, talking how it can get messy &amp; then following up with examples of improving that code. Hopefully this talk will start a lot of discussion afterwards.

This approach helps organize and minimize the essential complexity of your software.  DDD has been used with success within the traditional enterprise programming ecosystems of Java and .NET, but has seen only limited adoption in the Python community. In this talk we introduce Python programmers to the core tactical patterns of DDD and show how they can be realised in idiomatic Python, freeing the most valuable parts of your system – the domain model – from onerous dependencies on particular databases or application frameworks. In this talk we share what we’ve learned from applying DDD in Python to large projects.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Software Design Abstractions Programming Architecture Databases</tags></item><item><title>Django queries optimization</title><author>Ivaylo Donchev</author><description>Collecting data from multiple Models is a common flow in Django development. In most of the cases prefetch_related and select_related do all of the job for optimizing the queries. When the models structure become complicated enough and we’ve put our logic for collecting these items in models’ properties we suddenly cannot use prefetch_related or select_related anymore. Our View ‘s queries count depends on selected items count with high complexity. The problem is in the selection logic: we’ve implemented an algorithm which calculates something and we cannot prefetch or select all of the objects. So this talk’s purpose is: To show how to use Django ORM to move the selection logic, the calculations, the aggregations over group of objects from our python code to our database and moving all of the logic for this in one place - the queryset and test it easily.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Django Databases PostgreSQL APIs</tags></item><item><title>Developing in a black hole: vim, tmux, httpie and jq</title><author>Francisco Javier Aceituno Lapido</author><description>“Productivity depends on the knowledge you have of the tools used.” Do you feel that the development tools you use are heavy?

Sometimes our code just isn’t working how we expect it to work.
When this happens, we fall back to our trusty tools to help us
debug: pdb, the logging module, or even simple print statements.  But sometimes
that just isn’t enough, we still can’t figure out why our code is broken.
We need something more. There are a number of fantastic libraries in python for
creating data visualizations.  These libraries are commonly used for
analyzing and visualizing large sets of data, but don’t see as much
usage when it comes to helping us write and debug our code. What if we could combine the two?  What if we could leverage data
visualization tools to understand what our program is doing?  Sometimes, by
seeing a visual representation of what our code is doing, it becomes much
easier to understand why our code is not working.  We don’t need to create
publication quality graphs and charts, we just need to generate quick, one-off
visualizations to understand what our code is doing.  What we want is the “data
visualization” equivalent to print() statements. To help illustrate this point, I will walk through some of the hardest
bugs I’ve had to track down while working on projects such as the AWS CLI and
boto3, the AWS SDK for Python.  For each bug, I’ll show you how I was able to
leverage data visualization techniques to troubleshoot and fix these bugs.
Come learn how to debug more efficiently by leveraging data visualization.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Public Cloud (AWS/Google/...)

The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and applies many static optimisations that make Python code run visibly faster than in the interpreter. But even better, it supports static type annotations that allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions, which the compiler uses to convert and optimise the code into fast, native C. The tight integration of all three languages, Python, C and C++, makes it possible to freely mix Python features like generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the same code. This talk by a core developer introduces the Cython compiler by interactive code examples, and shows how you can use it to speed up your Python code. You will learn how you can profile a Python module and use Cython to compile and optimise it into a fast binary extension module. All of that, without losing the ability to run it through common development tools like static analysers or coverage test tools.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Cython Compiler and Interpreters C-Languages Performance</tags></item><item><title>Code Review Skills for Pythonistas</title><author>Nina Zakharenko</author><description>As teams and projects grow, code review becomes increasingly important to support the maintainability of complex codebases. In this talk, I’ll cover guidelines for writing consistent python code beyond pep8, how to look out for common python gotchas, and what python tools are available to automate various parts of the review process. Most importantly, I’ll cover the human aspect of code reviews - how we can be better at approaching reviews with empathy and understanding from the perspective of both a reviewer and a submitter. Following these successful code review practices will lead to happier teams and healthier code bases. This talk is useful for python developers with any amount of experience. No prerequisite knowledge is necessary. 
- For those who are just starting out, it will be a great general overview.
- Intermediate developers may not know about the wide variety of tooling that’s available.
- Advanced developers will learn techniques for performing code reviews with empathy. This talk will enable you to have better code reviews on your teams at work, and a better approach to code reviews in open source projects. You’ll leave with 3 main takeaways:
 1. Code Reviews are most effective when conducted with empathy. If you do reviews with growth and learning in mind, they become tools for sharing knowledge instead of an opportunity to bruise egos or show off esoteric knowledge.
 2. Python has powerful tooling available for code reviews such as pep8 as a style guide, pylint as a linter, coverage.py to identify test coverage, and vulture to identify dead code.
 3. That python style guides beyond pep8 have clear benefits in terms of producing more consistent code that’s easier to review and easier to maintain.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Development Clean Code Programming Open-Source Code Analysis</tags></item><item><title>Creating a Culture of Software Craftsmanship</title><author>Keith Harrison</author><description>This time it’ll be different.

A change in one place causes bugs in a completely different place. Adding a simple feature means making changes all over your application. Progress is getting slower and slower. You’re lost in complexity. Why does this keep happening and what can we do about it? This talk will try to answer those questions. I’ll show how complex software really is, define the different types of complexity found in software, explain the issues complexity causes and discuss different techniques we can use to manage it.

Thus it is increasingly important that your APIs are well-designed and easy to consume for other developers. Adding a few API endpoints to your application for internal consumption is easy. Creating APIs that other developers will love to use is a much harder problem.
You’ll need to think about solving variety of topics such as versioning, authentication, response structure, documentation and more. There are existing good practices for each of them, but often developers who haven’t done a lot of API work aren’t familiar with them. My talk will show how to find reasonable solutions for those problems.
I will talk about importance and intricacies of good documentation and why auto-generating it from your code is useful. I’ll show how to make use of familiarity by using standards such as JSON API and show benefits brought by its standardized response structure that makes lives of 3rd-party developers easier. Authentication will be discussed, including introduction to OAuth2. I’ll talk about when OAuth2 is a good choice and when not, as well as dig into some trickier parts of it.
We’ll then move on to versioning and how you can change your API without breaking all existing apps.

The benefit of this is that we are in control of the complexity and we know exactly what is being played. We start out simple and then start adding more instruments, different timbres, etc. As we go up in complexity, we shall see how to adapt our models to be able to deal with it.

in a variety of practical tasks. For a number of years, it has remained the primary method for
learning problems with heterogeneous features, noisy data, and complex dependencies: web search,
recommendation systems, weather forecasting, and many others.
CatBoost (http://catboost.yandex) is a new open-source gradient boosting library, that outperforms existing publicly available implementations of gradient boosting in terms of quality. It has a set of addional advantages. CatBoost is able to incorporate categorical features in your data (like music genre, URL, search query, etc.) in predictive models with no additional preprocessing. For more details on our approach please refer to our NIPS 2017 ML Systems Workshop paper (http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_11.pdf). CatBoost inference is 20-60 times faster then in other open-source gradient boosting libraries, which makes it possible to use CatBoost for latency-critical tasks. CatBoost has the fastest GPU and multi GPU training implementations of all the openly available gradient boosting libraries. CatBoost requires no hyperparameter tunning in order to get a model with good quality. CatBoost is highly scalable and can be efficiently trained using hundreds of machines The talk will cover a broad description of gradient boosting and its areas of usage and the differences between CatBoost and other gradient boosting libraries. We will also briefly explain the details of the proprietary algorithm that leads to a boost in quality.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Big Data Data Science Open-Source Machine-Learning</tags></item><item><title>Building new NLP solutions with spaCy and Prodigy</title><author>Matthew Honnibal</author><description>Commercial machine learning projects are currently like start-ups: many projects fail, but some are extremely successful, justifying the total investment.

In this talk, I will discuss how to address some of the most likely causes of failure for new Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. My main recommendation is to take an iterative approach: don’t assume you know what your pipeline should look like, let alone your annotation schemes or model architectures. I will also discuss a few tips for figuring out what’s likely to work, along with a few common mistakes.

Huge teams of well-payed data scientists often present one fancy model after the other to their managers but their proof of concepts never manifest into something business relevant. The frustration grows on both sides, managers and data scientists. In my talk I elaborate on the many reasons why data science to production is such a hard nut to crack. I start with a taxonomy of data use cases in order to easier assess technical requirements. Based thereon, my focus lies on overcoming the two-language-problem which is Python/R loved by data scientists vs. the enterprise-established Java/Scala. From my project experiences I present three different solutions, namely 1) migrating to a single language, 2) reimplementation and 3) usage of a framework. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach is presented and general advices based on the introduced taxonomy is given. Additionally, my talk also addresses organisational as well as problems in quality assurance and deployment. Best practices and further references are presented on a high-level in order to cover all facets of data science to production. With my talk I hope to convey the message that breakdowns on the road from data science to production are rather the rule than the exception, so you are not alone. At the end of my talk, you will have a better understanding of why your team and you are struggling and what to do about it.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Best Practice Data Science Clean Code DevOps general Business</tags></item><item><title>Building a Naive Bayes Text Classifier with scikit-learn</title><author>Obiamaka Agbaneje</author><description>Machine learning algorithms used in the classification of text are Support Vector Machines, k Nearest Neighbors but the most popular algorithm to implement is Naive Bayes because of its simplicity based on Bayes Theorem. The Naive Bayes classifier is able to memorise the relationships between the training attributes and the outcome and predicts by multiplying the conditional probabilities of the attributes with the assumption that they are independent of the outcome.  It is popularly used in classifying data sets that have a large number of features that are sparse or nearly independent such as text documents.

Especially when you have dozens of them. Besides being tedious , making a new release can be a very error prone process. Maybe you forgot to run the full test suite, forgot to update the release version or tag the release on VCS or maybe you bungled up the upload to PyPI. Fortunately there are things you can do to eliminate entire categories of human errors in the release process – by automating them. This talk uses a trivial project as an example to present a release pipeline, from packaging and testing to deployment, that only requires you to push a git tag to your Github repository. Automation then takes care of the rest and you end up with a new release on PyPI (yay!). This talk is mostly useful for open source developers using Github to house their projects, as it heavily leans on Travis, its continuous integration provider . You also need to be at least somewhat familiar with Python packaging and testing in order to follow along.

Finding novel,
efficient solutions to complex day-to-day problems with Pandas not only saves time, but can be fun
and rewarding experience. In this talk I’ll present use cases I had to solve, but the “traditional” approach proved tough
and/or otherwise frustrating implement nicely. Since I was just starting to learn Pandas, decided to
try an alternative solution with it. What I learned changed the way I think about data processing
with Python, and it only got better since! The use cases deals with extracting pen strokes from handwritten SVG samples, and recomposing them
into reusable letters and numbers. When you need to compare each stroke to all others, often more
than once, resulted in inefficient, slow, and hard to maintain code. Even a naive Pandas approach
with loops helped to reduce both the memory footprint, and improve the performance considerably!
Improving the implementation further, vectorizing inner loops, and taking advantage of multi-index
operations, I managed to get the same results, using less memory and a lot faster (by orders of
magnitude).</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date></item><item><title>Air Quality &amp; Python: Developing Online Analysis Tools</title><author>Douglas Finch</author><description>Poor surface air quality has a range of implications for human health and the economy. Without concerted mitigation efforts, trends in urbanisation and aspirations for progressive economic growth will result in poorer levels of air quality. Analysing and interpreting the incoming data streams from heterogeneous air quality measurement stations is critical for tackling the problem and for developing early warning systems. I am using Python to develop a set of online analysis tools (ukatmos.org) to enable the public to quickly and easily plot air quality data in many ways, effectively freeing up information that is already publicly available but in awkward formats and often involves development of code. We anticipate these tools will also support data science classes at school, and can speed up scientific research by minimizing effort in repeating analyses. This talk will cover how the tools integrate numerous Python libraries (e.g. Pandas and NumPy), the Django web framework, the Plot.ly tools for creating interactive graphs, and SQL to address the large data volumes. Developing these Python tools in an adaptive and scalable way allows it to grow as more data become available, e.g. satellite observations. Adaptability also includes evolving user requirements. This project will also be developed into a Python library allowing the user to easily use the online analysis tools from an offline Python environment.</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Case Study Data Science Django Web Science</tags></item><item><title>Adventures in compatibility: emulating CPython's C API in PyPy</title><author>Ronan Lamy</author><description>PyPy is a fast and compliant implementation of Python. In other words, it’s an interpreter for the Python language that can act as a full replacement for the reference interpreter, CPython. It’s optimised to enable efficient just-in-time compilation of Python code to machine code, and has releases matching versions 2.7, 3.5 and soon(ish) 3.6. The PyPy project also developed cffi as a clean and efficient way of interfacing with C code. However, many libraries in the Python ecosystem are implemented as C extensions, which target CPython’s C API. Many others use Cython, which builds C extensions under the hood. Therefore, PyPy needs an emulation layer for the C API. This emulation needs to bridge the differences between the implementation languages and the object models of CPython and PyPy. The solution is called cpyext. It’s implemented in a mixture of RPython and C, with most of the API functions and macros implemented in RPython. cpyext exposes PyObjects to the extension code that appear similar to CPython objects (as long as extension writers stay within the fuzzily defined boundaries of the public API) but are merely ‘shadows’ of the real PyPy objects. After a brief presentation of PyPy, its goals, and its current statuts and roadmap, this talk will dive into the vexed topic of its handling of C extensions.  By the end of it, the audience should understand the operating principles of cpyext and have a clearer understanding of what happens when you install and run numpy, for instance, on top of PyPy. Some basic familiarity with CPython internals and how C extensions are made will be assumed.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>PyPy Compiler and Interpreters C-Languages Scientific Libraries (Numpy/Pandas/SciKit/...)</tags></item><item><title>Addressing multithreading and multiprocessing in transparent and Pythonic ways</title><author>David Liu</author><description>With the increase in computing power, harnessing and controlling one’s code out of the single-threaded realm becomes an ever-increasing problem, coupled with the desire to stay in the Python layer.

Overview: Introduction to multithreading and multiprocessing in Python History of multithreading+multiprocessing in Python, classic frameworks Problems that can occur (oversubscription, nested parallelism issues, process hopping, pool resource on shared machines) Python accessing bigger hardware over the last few years (28+ cores, etc) When to stay in the GIL, and when to escape it The advantages and safety of the GIL Python-level exiting of the GIL; analysis of when to return to single-threaded, and when threading is a deceivingly bad idea Accountability of frameworks that natively exit the GIL The new multithreading and multiprocessing libraries and techniques static multiprocessing module (smp) (and monkey patching of multiprocessing) thread pool control with command line calls of Python ( python -m tbb -p 8) Putting it all together Examples of using static multiprocessing on a large machine to stop oversubscription Example of pseudo-daemon process on 4-core machine by processor pinning Thread pool control on a simple NumPy example Summary - Best practices for using above methods to control multithreading+multiprocessing What needs to be done in the space (frameworks and things that need to be exposed) Problems that still exist in the area Q&amp;A</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Best Practice Multi-Processing Multi-Threading CPython Scientific Libraries (Numpy/Pandas/SciKit/...)</tags></item><item><title>A Taxonomy of Decorators: A-E</title><author>Andy Fundinger</author><description>This talk will briefly go over the various decorator syntaxes before breaking up the common usages of decorators into 5 categories.

That code was filled with very long functions, some of them with very similar code and the project was really hard to understand as a whole. My first reflex was to refactor this code code to make it more understandable. In my opinion, it did fit part of my assignment as understandable code is easier to maintain but it was also very helpful later in letting me make small changes with full knowledge of what was going to be affected by those changes. Large methods and functions is something that creeps into our code whether we plan for it or not. This talk is about one way to deal with it. This talk will be based on code provided by the GildedRose Refcatoring Kata: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Basic knowledge of OOP Goals:
- Demonstrate one approach for refactoring code
- Show how to leverage Python’s dynamic nature to make code simpler</description><date>Friday 27 July</date><tags>Case Study Programming Code Analysis failures/mistakes Clean Code</tags></item><item><title>A Python implementation in Rust?</title><author>Windel Bouwman</author><description>Rust is a fairly new programming language aimed as a competitor of C.
There are already attempts to write extension modules in rust and load
them into CPython. A whole new approach would be to re-implement the Python
language in rust. This is what the rspython project is about: implementing
a python interpreter in rust. Rust already has many features such as vectors,
hashmaps and strings as unicode. There also exist already modules for
regular expressions and dealing with files, so a lot can be re-used in
this area. During this talk we will dive into rust and python and the design of
the rspython. We will present some challenges and opportunities. Also
we will show the current state of this project in a demo.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Compiler and Interpreters Python 3</tags></item><item><title>A Jupyter Enhancement Proposal Story</title><author>Raniere Silva</author><description>Python users should be familiar with the concept of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), the way that the Python language evolves over time. In a similar fashion, the Jupyter project has Jupyter Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). This talk with cover the proposer first-hand experience when submiting JEP 23 - Add Template as Metatada enhancement proposal from it’s beginning, during EuroPython 2017, up to its current status. We will, in addition, present efforts made as part of the OpenDreamKit project to perform Jupyter notebooks conversions using custom metadata, templates, and exporters, in a programmatic way. Outline 0:00 - 0:05 Who are we? We are impostors!
0:05 - 0:10 Our previous experience with Jupyter Notebook. We will talk about the time that Software Carpentry used Jupyter Notebook for their lesson creation and OpenDreamKit Jupyter notebook programmatic notebooks conversion.
0:10 - 0:15 You are not alone. We will talk how the idea for the Jupyter Enhancement Proposals (JEPs) borned at EuroPython 2017 Help Desk
0:15 - 0:20 Writing our first Jupyter Enhancement Proposals. We will cover our steps to create the pull request required by the Jupyter Project.
0:20 - 0:25 What is the current status of the Jupyter Enhancement Proposals? We will cover any progress from the time of this talk proposal submission and the date of it presentation.

Platforms are steadily becoming more mature, useful tools are released almost daily and things that seemed hopelessly futuristic only a few years ago are suddenly commercially viable. Despite this, the software world is awash with bullshit. The success of the largest technology companies has led to a very skewed set of lessons. This narrow focus is amplified by the venture capital industry and the fact that nobody really knows what’s going to happen next. The good news is, none of this actually matters. The basics of creating something useful and selling it for money remain the same. In this talk, I’m not going to give you “one weird trick” or tell you to ~* just follow your dreams *~. But I’ll share some of the things we’ve learned from building a successful software company around commercial developer tools and our open-source library spaCy.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice Use Case failures/mistakes Business Natural Language Processing</tags></item><item><title>10 years of EuroPython and the Python community</title><author>Dougal Matthews</author><description>This talk will take you on a journey from Birmingham to Edinburgh via Florence, Berlin, Bilbao and Rimini. The last 10 years of EuroPython. This will be a trip down memory lane where we look at how the language, community and conference have evolved with some personal anecdotes along the way. This will be in part a retrospective, where we will look at what we have done well and where we can do better. Finally, we will look at some aspirations and ideas for the coming years.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>EuroPython Community</tags></item><item><title>White Mars: living far away from any form of life</title><author>Marco Buttu</author><description>Concordia Station is a French/Italian facility located inside Antarctica, in a plateau called Dome-C, in the middle of nowhere. A dark and cold place: no Sun from May to August, temperatures around -80 Celsius degress, no life. Here I am living and performing scientific research with other 12 collegues from Italy, France and Austria. We are the most isolated people on Earth, more than the austronauts in the International Space Station. There is no way to move from Concordia until November, and no one can come. It is like to live in another planet, and that is why the European Space Agency is interested in making bio-medical research on us, in order to better understand how the human body behaves in a such extraterrestrial environment. We will introduce our studies, describe this place and our life here, and of course also speak about Python.</description><date>Wednesday 25 July</date><tags>Science Case Study</tags></item><item><title>Die Threads</title><author>David Beazley</author><description>In the brave new world of async, threads are now a thing of the past.

I want the audience to learn from my mistakes! For instance, how easy it is to get into “callback hell” (and how to avoid/get out of it), how to screw up thread safety and deadlock yourself, and making code async but not actually concurrent. I’ll talk through some anti-patterns and best practices that I learned the hard way. This includes proper concurrency, calling coroutines from synchronous code, working with threads and threadsafety, properly shutting down an async programs, and hidden “gotchas”.</description><date>Thursday 26 July</date><tags>Best Practice ASYNC / Concurreny failures/mistakes Multi-Threading</tags></item></items>
